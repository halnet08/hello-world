Hello!

32 year old insurance salesman from Sweden here, embarking on a mission to break into the 
coding scene. Starting out gently with CSS and HTML, Javascript will follow, and from there on.. 
PHP, frameworks, and other things. Taking things step by step.

Got two cats. They like food, hoomans and sleep. They like no other things. They really dislike door bells.
And expensive-as-hell-tuna. They like the cheap stuff.

I usually have a lot of hobbies. 3d-printing, setting up raspberrie pi:s to do unnecessary things, 
retro hockey games. Those hobbies are set on hold. Focus, I believe, is a good thing.

Got a fiancée whom I love dearly. She bought me comic hero t-shirts. Wasn´t even my birthday.
I bought her flowers. She won that round.

Last and least, I enjoy buying cheap electronic components from China, then putting them in a box and
never seeing them again.
